    <p>This is 60 seconds.</p>
    <p>60 seconds in a bunker survival game <br> where you have to collect as many resources as you can before you get into <br> the bunker. 
        When you are in the bunker, <br> you have to ration the food between the family in order to survive.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, one or a few of the family members will leave the bunker to collect resources, but unfortunately they usually 
        donâ€™t come back....</p>
    <p>I like this game because of the strategy aspect - you have to think what is most important in order to survive.</p>
